			CodeQuilt is a collaborative project in which students take ownership of their own stories about coding (stories often lost and ignored across apps, websites, and other digital media) by designing digital quilt patches. Together, these patches form a collective quilt representing their new stories and visions for who can code and why we code.
			</p>
			<p>
			Take a look at the <a id="close" href="#close">current quilt</a> and add your own patch by following the <a target="_blank" href="">tutorial</a>.
			</p>
			<p>We invite teachers and students to create and share their own patches.
